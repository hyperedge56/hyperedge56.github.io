            So far, my favorite CMSC subjects have been CMSC 22 and 12. Simplicity with high-level PLs as well as the use of user libraries is vastly more fun than anything else I've encountered.

        <h2>
            My favorite GE subject is COMM 10. The feeling of the flowing words is something I will always crave, especially on topics like movies and philosophy.

        <h2>
            My favorite PL is Python. It just works, you know? No leaky memory, no complicated pointers. Everything just works.

            My favorite food is a nice breakfast burritto and a small hash brown.
