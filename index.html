            So far, my favorite CMSC subjects have been CMSC 22 and 12. Simplicity with high-level PLs as well as the use of user libraries is vastly more fun than anything else I've encountered.
        </h2>
        <h2>
            My favorite GE subject is COMM 10. The feeling of the flowing words is something I will always crave, especially on topics like movies and philosophy.
        </h2>
        <h2>
            My favorite PL is Python. It just works, you know? No leaky memory, no complicated pointers. Everything just works.

            My favorite food is a nice breakfast burritto and a small hash brown.

            <p style="font-weight: bold;">
                &emsp;When I was young, I was always very sick. I had a weak immune system and I was always in the hospital. Because of that, I became
                used to seeing my doctor every week. Over time, they became symbols of safety and discipline in my eyes. I wanted to become a doctor
                because of that experience. I wanted to help people and give them the safety and support they needed. I think the first kind of doctor
                I wanted to be was a surgeon. It was only recently that I started looking into psychiatry and psychology.
